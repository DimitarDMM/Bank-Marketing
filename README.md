# Bank Classification

Bank customer analysis has always been and will always be a topical issue. 
The increasing number of campaigns in recent years reduces their effectiveness, so the market itself makes the campaigns to be conducted on a specific target group.

In order to be able to define a successful campaign, it is necessary to make a market analysis as well as a customer analysis. 
It is important to know who is our target group, what kind of campaign it is and of course how financially it would be supported.

In this project, exactly these components are joined.
It is about telemarketing for a Portuguese bank with data available in the period from 2008 to 2013. 
The dataset initially contains 22 processed and required features for analysis.
